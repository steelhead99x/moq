# OBS Plugin

An OBS Studio plugin for publishing and consuming MoQ streams.

::: warning Work in Progress
This plugin is currently under development, but works pretty gud.
:::

## Overview

The OBS plugin allows you to:

- **Publish** directly from OBS to a MoQ relay
- **Subscribe** to MoQ broadcasts as an OBS source

It loads into a stock OBS Studio install. You no longer need to build OBS from source to use it.

## Building

The plugin lives in-tree under `cpp/obs/`. It links `libmoq`, which is built from the in-tree `rs/libmoq` crate via cargo (CMake's `MOQ_LOCAL` points at the repo root by default), so there is no prebuilt release to download.

Build it when you want to *run* it. To check that a change compiles, reach for [`just obs compile`](#type-checking) instead: on macOS and Windows a real build first downloads the multi-hundred-MB obs-deps bundle into the tree it's building in, which is per-worktree.

### Linux (Nix)

`libobs`, `Qt6`, and `ffmpeg` come from the dev shell; no system packages required.

```bash
nix develop
just obs build
```

### macOS

The macOS build is fully native, **not** Nix. The build spec (`cpp/obs/buildspec.json`) downloads the prebuilt obs-deps bundle (`libobs`, `Qt6`, and `ffmpeg`) on first configure, so no Homebrew packages are needed.

Requirements:

- Full **Xcode** (not just the Command Line Tools): `sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app`
- Run **outside** the Nix dev shell. The Nix toolchain sets `DEVELOPER_DIR`/`NIX_LDFLAGS`, which break the Xcode build. If you use direnv, run from a plain terminal or `exit` the shell first.

```bash
just obs setup   # downloads obs-deps, configures via the macOS preset
just obs build
just obs run     # copies the plugin into ~/Library/Application Support/obs-studio/plugins and launches OBS
```

### Windows

Needs Visual Studio 2022. Run from Git Bash (for `just`); the build spec downloads obs-deps the same way as macOS.

```bash
just obs setup
just obs build
```

### Type-checking

`just obs compile` type-checks every plugin source without linking, and without downloading anything:

```bash
nix develop
just obs compile
```

This is the gate to run while working, because it needs headers rather than libraries, and the dev shell carries all of them on every platform. `libobs` comes from the `libobs-headers` package in `flake.nix`, which unpacks the headers from the same OBS release `buildspec.json` pins; `Qt6` and `ffmpeg` come from nixpkgs. It regenerates `target/include/moq.h` first, so a call to a `libmoq` function whose signature has since changed is a compile error rather than something you find out about later.

It compiles the Qt sources too, which the CMake build only does when `ENABLE_QT` and `ENABLE_FRONTEND_API` are on. `just check` runs it for you when a branch touches `cpp/obs/` or `rs/libmoq/`.

### Compiling in CI

[`obs.yml`](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/blob/main/.github/workflows/obs.yml) compiles **and links** the plugin, then runs the [unit tests](#tests), on every PR that touches the plugin, `rs/libmoq/`, a workspace manifest or build script, or the flake. It runs on Linux, the one platform where the whole dependency set (`libobs`, `Qt6`, `ffmpeg`) comes from nixpkgs with no obs-deps bundle to download. The plugin is platform-independent C++ over libmoq's C ABI, so this catches what a macOS developer would otherwise ship uncompiled. `just obs ci` is the same recipe locally.

The filter reaches past `cpp/obs/` because this is the only place `libmoq.a` is linked from outside cargo, which needs the hand-maintained native-library lists in `rs/libmoq/native-libs/`. A dependency that starts pulling in a new native library leaves those stale, and every Rust gate stays green because cargo passes the flag itself. No list of paths catches all of those, so [`nightly.yml`](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/blob/main/.github/workflows/nightly.yml) runs the same recipe diff-independently as the backstop.

### Which OBS version

Three places name an OBS release, and `just obs check` compares all three:

- `cpp/obs/buildspec.json` names the obs-deps bundle the macOS and Windows builds download, so this is what the released binaries link.
- `flake.nix`'s `libobs-headers` is what `just obs compile` type-checks against on every platform. It must equal `buildspec.json` exactly; both unpack the same OBS tag.
- nixpkgs' `obs-studio` is what `just obs ci` links on Linux. This one comes from `flake.lock` rather than from us, so only its `major.minor` has to match: a patch release carries no libobs API change, and the guard should fire on the nixpkgs bump that opens a real gap, not on every one.

Bumping the first two together means new SHA-256 hashes for the OBS source archive (`.tar.gz` for macOS, `.zip` for Windows), the prebuilt obs-deps and Qt6 archives, and the nix `fetchzip` hash. The obs-deps version and hashes to use are the ones in the target OBS release's own `CMakePresets.json`, under the `dependencies` configure preset.

### Tests

`just obs test` compiles the plugin sources against stubbed `libobs`, `libmoq` and FFmpeg under ThreadSanitizer, and drives the callback orderings directly rather than waiting for them. There is one binary per source under test, because each test file defines its own stubs:

- `test/moq-output-test.cpp` covers the publish side: a connection that fails permanently, a terminal arriving mid-`Start()`, a restart, and one arriving while the output is being destroyed.
- `test/moq-source-test.cpp` covers the consume side: an announcement that arrives after the session reports connected, a broadcast that is never announced, a delivery belonging to a connection that has already been replaced, and the subscription reference count returning to zero on the delivered, errored and closed paths.

Run them after touching `cpp/obs/src/`.

```bash
just obs test
```

`just obs ci` runs the same tests without the sanitizer, and that is the copy which gates a merge: `obs.yml` invokes that recipe, while `just obs test` is manual. ThreadSanitizer adds the interleavings on top, needs its own build, and needs a Clang or GCC whose runtime *runs* on the host, so `just obs test` fails rather than skipping when one isn't available. On Windows run it from WSL, since neither MSVC nor Clang on Windows implements ThreadSanitizer.

Both find the `libobs` headers the same way `just obs compile` does, and regenerate `moq.h` the same way; set `OBS_INCLUDE_DIR` to point somewhere else. That shared step asks cargo where the header landed and reads the answer with `jq`, so outside the dev shell (running from WSL, say) `jq` has to be installed alongside cargo and the compiler.

## Releases

The plugin statically links `libmoq`, so it ships with every libmoq release rather than on its own schedule. The [`libmoq` workflow](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/blob/main/.github/workflows/libmoq.yml) (triggered by a `libmoq-v*` tag) rebuilds the plugin against the libmoq release it just published, then cuts a matching `obs-moq-v<version>` release with **macOS (arm64)** and **Windows (x64)** binaries. `cpp/obs/build.sh --libmoq-release <version>` drives each build (it fetches the prebuilt libmoq archive, so no second cargo build).

### Download

Latest and older builds: [moq-dev/moq Releases](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/releases) (filter tags named `obs-moq-v*`).

Each `obs-moq-v*` release attaches platform archives. Pick the one for your OS; you do not need to build from source to use the plugin on macOS or Windows.

### Install (prebuilt)

Archives are **unsigned**, so macOS Gatekeeper and Windows SmartScreen will warn on first load (right-click → Open on macOS).

**macOS (arm64)**

1. Download the macOS archive from the `obs-moq-v*` release.
2. Extract `obs-moq.plugin`.
3. Copy it into `~/Library/Application Support/obs-studio/plugins/`.
4. Restart OBS Studio. MoQ appears as a service (Settings → Stream), a source, and a dock.

**Windows (x64)**

1. Download the Windows archive from the `obs-moq-v*` release.
2. Extract the `obs-moq/` folder (it contains `bin/64bit/` and `data/`).
3. Copy that folder into your OBS plugins directory, typically `%AppData%\obs-studio\plugins\`.
4. Restart OBS Studio.

**Linux**

No portable prebuilt yet (the plugin links ffmpeg for subscribed decode, and a distro/nix ffmpeg is not loadable into stock OBS). Build from source with `nix develop` and `just obs build` (see [Linux](#linux-nix) above).

### Discoverability

GitHub Releases are the supported download path today. An OBS Forum / plugin-directory listing is deferred until binaries are signed and (for Linux) a portable artifact exists; unsigned one-click installs fight Gatekeeper/SmartScreen and confuse first-run support.

## Usage

### Publishing

1. Open OBS Studio
2. Go to Settings > Stream
3. Select "MoQ" as the service
4. Enter your relay URL and path
5. Click "Start Streaming"

### Subscribing

1. Add a new source
2. Select "MoQ Source"
3. Enter the relay URL and broadcast path
4. The stream will appear in your scene

### Reconnect

libmoq retries the connection after a drop. Transient failures stay inside the
library: the plugin is not told until reconnect permanently gives up (or you stop).

Tune pacing under **Advanced** (Settings → Stream, or the dock's **Advanced…** button):

- **Reconnect delay** / **Reconnect delay cap**: backoff floor and ceiling
- **Give up after**: total budget before the attempt ends; `0` retries forever.
  That budget is also how long the broadcast stays available to viewers across the gap.

On the publish side, a permanent failure after a successful connect is reported as
a disconnect so OBS can restart the output. The MoQ Source blanks and stays down
until you change its settings (or recreate it); it does not open a second retry loop.

### Status / stats

The MoQ dock polls connection health about once a second while live:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Connecting… | Start pressed; first connect callback has not fired yet |
| Connected | Live session; may include reconnects, RTT, ↑/↓ rates, loss, bytes sent |
| Reconnecting… | Was connected; libmoq is between attempts (no live stats); reconnect count kept |
| Disconnected | Not streaming |

Figures come from the existing 1 Hz dock poll: reconnect count from the libmoq
connect epoch, and the rest from one `moq_session_stats` snapshot. Missing fields
are omitted rather than shown as zero. No extra network traffic.

### Advanced settings

The defaults are what you want for streaming to a normal relay. The advanced settings
exist for testing against a specific protocol draft, reaching a relay with a self-signed
certificate, and diagnosing a connection that misbehaves.

They live in two places, backed by the same values:

- **Settings > Stream**, under the collapsible **Advanced** group. Saved with the rest of
  the service, so they travel with the profile.
- **The MoQ dock**, via the **Advanced…** button, which opens them in their own window so
  the dock stays small.

Everything is ignored unless the group is switched on. With the group off, the plugin
connects with the libmoq defaults. If a value is rejected (an unknown version, an
unparseable bind address), the stream refuses to start and the log records which setting
was rejected and why.

| Setting | What it's for |
| --- | --- |
| Protocol version | Pin the handshake to one draft instead of offering all of them. The menu lists what this build offers; a work-in-progress draft can be typed in. |
| QUIC backend | Pick one of the backends compiled into this libmoq build instead of its default. |
| Bind address | Send from a specific local address, e.g. `192.0.2.7:0` to pin the outgoing interface. |
| Connect timeout | Bound on one attempt, dial and handshake together. `0` waits forever. |
| Happy Eyeballs delay | How long before also trying the next address DNS returned. |
| Skip certificate verification | Development only: accepts any certificate. Prefer a fingerprint. |
| Certificate fingerprint | Trust one self-signed certificate by its SHA-256 hex fingerprint, the native equivalent of the browser's `serverCertificateHashes`. |
| Root certificate | Trust a PEM CA instead of the system roots. |
| Server name override | Validate against this name instead of the URL host, so a relay can be reached by IP. |
| Reconnect delay / cap / give up after | Retry pacing after a drop. "Give up after" is also how long the broadcast lingers for viewers across the gap; `0` retries forever. |
| Congestion control | Delay-based (BBR) keeps queues short and the send rate steady enough for an encoder to track. Loss-based (CUBIC) chases throughput. |
| Max concurrent streams | MoQ opens a stream per group, so a busy publisher wants this high. |
| Idle timeout / Keep-alive | Connection liveness. A keep-alive of `0` disables the pings. |
| UDP segmentation offload | Batches sends into one syscall. Turn it off if large sends vanish; some NICs and middleboxes mangle segmented packets. |
| Path MTU discovery | Leave it automatic for the library's choice, or explicitly enable or disable it. |
| qlog directory | On builds with qlog support, write QUIC connection traces here for diagnosing stalls. The files get large. |
| WebSocket fallback (+ delay) | Race a WebSocket connection against QUIC so a network that blocks UDP still goes live. Turn it off to measure the QUIC path alone. |
