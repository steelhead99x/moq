# @moq/watch

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@moq/watch)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@moq/watch)

A player: subscribes to a broadcast, picks renditions, decodes with
WebCodecs, renders video to a canvas and audio through WebAudio, and keeps them
in sync at the latency you ask for.

```html
<script type="module">
    import "@moq/watch/element";
    import "@moq/watch/ui";       // optional overlay
</script>

<moq-watch-ui>
    <moq-watch url="https://relay.example.com/anon" name="room/alice.hang">
        <canvas></canvas>
    </moq-watch>
</moq-watch-ui>
```

## Attributes

| Attribute | |
| --- | --- |
| `url`, `name` | Relay URL (with `?jwt=` if needed) and broadcast name. |
| `paused`, `muted`, `volume` | The usual player controls, mirrored as reactive properties. |
| `latency` | Target latency: `"real-time"` (derived from RTT, the default), a number of ms, or `"instant"` to paint frames as they decode with no pacing at all. |
| `latency-min`, `latency-max` | Open a range instead: buffer freely between the floor and the ceiling and only skip ahead past the ceiling. |
| `jitter` | The jitter buffer in ms. |
| `visible` | Only subscribe to video while the element is on screen: a margin (`"20%"` default, `"200px"`), `"always"`, or `"never"`. |
| `reload` | Wait for the broadcast to be announced before subscribing (default on), so a player can be mounted before the stream exists. |
| `catalog-format` | `hang` (default, from the `.hang` suffix), `hangz` (compressed), `msf`, or `manual` to supply the catalog yourself. |

The overlay adds play/pause, volume, fullscreen, a quality selector, a
buffering indicator, an unsupported-codec warning, and a stats panel.
`<moq-watch-support>` shows what the browser can play.

## Custom tracks

`broadcast.subscribeTrack(name, priority, consume)` follows the active
broadcast across reconnects for any application track, and the loose catalog
passes your own sections through to `broadcast.catalog`. Decode JSON with
`@moq/json`. Reach the pipeline from the element via `el.broadcast`,
`el.video`, `el.audio`, and `el.signals`.

## Without the element

```ts
import * as Watch from "@moq/watch";

const broadcast = new Watch.Broadcast({ connection, enabled: true, name: "alice.hang" });
```

`Watch.Broadcast`, `Video.Decoder`, `Video.Renderer`, `Audio.Decoder`, and
`Audio.Emitter` are the pieces the element assembles; every input and output
is a signal from [`@moq/signals`](/lib/js/signals). Load from a CDN
(`https://esm.sh/@moq/watch/element`) for a no-build embed.

## Spatial playback

`Audio.Decoder` can take a shared `AudioContext` as the `context` constructor
knob. Every remote then lives in one graph (one `AudioListener`, many
`PannerNode`s). The decoder never closes an injected context; match its sample
rate to the decoded PCM (typically 48 kHz Opus). Connect `decoder.out.root` to
your panner or gain node. Do not use `Audio.Emitter` for positioned sources: it
always wires the root to `destination`. Set `enabled` false to stop downloading
a remote that is out of earshot.

## Buffered playback

By default the player minimizes latency: it skips ahead whenever the buffer
grows past the target. Content produced faster than real time, such as a TTS
response emitted in one burst with future timestamps, wants the opposite. Set
`latency-max` above `latency-min` to play through at the encoded pace:

```html
<moq-watch url="..." name="bot/tts.hang" latency-min="100" latency-max="30000"></moq-watch>
```

Only the floor is held as decoded PCM; the rest stays as encoded frames with
backpressure on the decoder, so a large ceiling is cheap. `el.reset()`
flushes and re-anchors at the next frame, which is how a producer interrupts
an utterance.
