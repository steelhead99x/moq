# Contributing

How a change lands in this repo: branch targeting, commits, PR descriptions, reviews, and releases. Coding conventions live in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) and the per-directory guides; this file covers the mechanics around the code.

## Branch Targeting

Two long-lived branches. The split is about **semver breakage of a published API, not size or novelty**: `dev` is only for changes that break the API contract consumers compile against. Everything else (bug fixes, new behavior, new/additive APIs, docs, refactors, wire-protocol work) goes to `main`, however large.

- **`main`**: the default. Bug fixes, new behavior, new/additive APIs, docs, and refactors that preserve the existing public API. A change that only *adds* is additive and lands here even when it is big: a new `pub` item, a new option, or a parser accepting a broader set of inputs it previously rejected. Changing what a component does with input it *already* takes (e.g. recognizing a media pattern it used to mishandle) is a fix, not a break, so it also lands here.

  Wire-protocol and format work lands here too, including `moq-lite` / `moq-transport` framing, a new draft version, a field added to or removed from an in-progress one, and catalog/container format changes in `rs/hang` or `js/hang`. Versions are negotiated per session, so a peer keeps speaking whatever version it already supports; the change reaches it only once both ends offer the new one. Ship it behind a version gate (see the Version matching section of [`rs/CLAUDE.md`](rs/CLAUDE.md)) and update the matching draft under `drafts/` in the same PR.
- **`dev`**: reserved for changes that violate semver by breaking a published API. That means a renamed, removed, or signature-changed `pub` (Rust) or exported (TS) item, or anything else that stops existing caller code compiling, such as adding a field to a struct consumers build with a literal. A newly *added* item is additive and goes to `main`.

  This covers **every package someone can depend on a released version of**, not a shortlist of the well-known ones: the `rs/` crates release-plz publishes, the `@moq/*` packages under `js/`, and the language wrappers under `swift/`, `kt/`, `go/`, `py/`. `libmoq` counts through its C ABI too, so a `moq.h` break is a `dev` change even though nothing depends on the crate.

  **`0.0.x` packages are the exception: break them on `main`.** Cargo and npm treat every `0.0.x` release as its own incompatible version, so such a package makes no compatibility promise and has no contract to violate. That covers `moq-audio`, `moq-video`, `moq-transcode`, and `moq-nvenc` today. The same goes for anything marked `publish = false` or `private` (`moq-bench`, `moq-wasm`, `@moq/wasm`, `@moq/clock`), which isn't published at all. Reshape their surface freely, and prefer doing so before a package leaves `0.0.x`, since that is the last cheap moment to fix a shape.

  A wire change usually needs no API break to land, since the version gate is internal. If yours does, that break is what sends the PR to `dev`, not the wire change itself.

`dev` periodically merges into `main` (or vice versa) when the batch is ready to ship. When in doubt, check the package's version before its name: `0.0.x` means break it on `main`, anything else means `dev`. Reviewers will redirect a PR that turns out to break a published API. CI (`pull_request:` workflows) runs on PRs against either branch, so no extra setup is needed when you switch the base.

## Commit Messages

PRs are squash-merged, so the PR title becomes the commit subject and the PR description becomes the body in `git log`. Write both for that reader.

- Use conventional-commit subjects (`feat(watch): ...`, `fix: ...`, `chore: ...`, `docs: ...`); release-plz derives crate changelogs from them.
- AI commit attribution goes in a `Co-Authored-By:` trailer, not the commit body.
- Never hand-bump a `version =` field in a feature PR. release-plz owns Rust version bumps; a manual bump breaks the Release RS workflow. (`py/moq-rs` is the exception: its version is bumped by hand.)
- Never commit binaries or build artifacts (`.a`, `.so`, `.dylib`, `.dll`, wheels). Release artifacts flow through GitHub Actions to mirror repos or Release assets.

## PR Descriptions

Keep the body short and structured, not narrated:

- **Summary**: a few bullets on what changed and why. For a bug fix, state the root cause (see Root Cause First in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)).
- **Public API changes**: every new/renamed/removed/signature-changed `pub` item in `rs/moq-*` and `js/*`, with breaking ones called out per [Branch Targeting](#branch-targeting). Distinguish genuinely public surface from `pub(crate)`/private.
- **Test plan**: what was run and verified.
- If you skip a [Cross-Package Sync](CLAUDE.md#cross-package-sync) row, say why.

Skip file-by-file narration of the diff; the diff already says that.

### Keep the title and description fresh

When pushing additional commits to an existing PR, check whether the title and description still describe the change accurately. They often go stale during review iterations: a flag gets renamed, an API gets reshaped, an extra fix lands. A stale title/body means a misleading entry in `git log` forever. Update with `gh pr edit <num> --title "..." --body "..."` whenever the scope shifts, watching for:

- Flags, file names, or public APIs renamed in later commits but still referenced by their old name in the body.
- Summary bullets describing behavior the latest commits have changed or removed.
- The test-plan checklist lagging behind newly added tests.

## AI Contributions

AI-assisted issues, pull requests, reviews, and comments are welcome. If the right solution is not obvious, open an issue before writing code so contributors and maintainers can brainstorm the approach together.

Every piece of LLM-authored prose posted to GitHub ends with the agent model, e.g. `(Written by GPT-5)`. That covers PR descriptions, issue bodies, review summaries, review replies, and any comment on a PR, issue, or discussion. Keep the marker when editing a body you authored, so readers still know it wasn't human-written.

The marker never goes in the codebase itself: no code comments, doc comments, or `/doc` pages (see Comment Conventions in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)). GitHub prose is read once, in context, by someone deciding how much to trust it; source markers just rot in place. Commits are the other exception: attribution belongs in a `Co-Authored-By:` trailer, not a marker in the body.

## Reviews

CodeRabbit reviews PRs automatically, but it has an hourly quota and runs out of org credits. If a PR shows a "Review limit reached" / "out of usage credits" message instead of an actual review (or CodeRabbit otherwise fails to produce one), run the `/review` skill locally against the PR. Then act on the findings the same way you would CodeRabbit's: push the high-confidence, unambiguous fixes directly, and escalate anything ambiguous, architectural, or open to interpretation by asking first rather than guessing.

Reply to review comments as you address them, saying what changed or why you disagree, so the reviewer doesn't have to diff the branch to find out. Replies are GitHub prose like any other, so they carry the [AI Contributions](#ai-contributions) marker.

When reviewing a PR, always include the same public API changes list described above, and call out anything breaking per [Branch Targeting](#branch-targeting).

Don't silently drop a real finding just because it's pre-existing or outside
the PR's diff. If the review surfaces a genuine problem (a bug, a footgun, a
convention the repo now violates) that you're not fixing in this PR, CREATE OR
UPDATE A QUEST for it (see [quest/AGENTS.md](quest/AGENTS.md)). "Out of scope"
is a reason to defer the fix, never a reason to forget it.

## Releases

- **Rust**: release-plz opens release PRs and publishes to crates.io on merge to `main` (`release-rs.yml`). `moq-relay` and `moq-cli` take patch bumps even for breaking changes (no external consumers yet). `moq-cli` is the one crate bumped by hand, in a dedicated chore PR rather than a feature PR, since release-plz can't see CLI surface changes.
- **JS**: `release-js.yml` publishes `@moq/*` packages (per-package build + `common/release.ts`).
- **Python**: `moq-ffi` releases on `moq-ffi-v*` tags; `moq-rs` publishes on merge to `main` when its hand-bumped version isn't already on PyPI. See `py/CLAUDE.md`.
- **Binding mirrors**: CI mirrors the `swift`/`kt`/`go` source skeletons to `moq-dev/moq-{swift,kotlin,go}` on each `moq-ffi-v*` tag.
