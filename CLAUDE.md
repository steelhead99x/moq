## Project Overview

MoQ (Media over QUIC) is a next-generation live media delivery protocol providing real-time latency at massive scale. It's a polyglot monorepo with Rust (server/native) and TypeScript/JavaScript (browser) implementations.

## Common Development Commands

```bash
# Code quality and testing
nix develop --command just check        # Lint and compile what the branch changed
nix develop --command just test         # Test what the branch changed, same scope
nix develop --command just fix          # Auto-fix lint/formatting, same scope
nix develop --command just check-all    # Same as check, over every package
nix develop --command just fix-all      # Same as fix, over every package
nix develop --command just build        # Build all packages
nix develop --command just bench        # Benchmark the current tree
nix develop --command just bench BASE   # Compare BASE with the current tree
```

Use the Nix dev shell for project commands so local runs match CI tooling. If Nix is unavailable, use `cargo` or `bun` directly.

`just bench` runs every Criterion target plus fixed video and 1:N fanout
workloads against a temporary local relay. Pass a commit or ref to benchmark that
revision first and print base-to-current changes. Timing changes are informational;
benchmark crashes, zero delivery, and invalid samples still fail the command. Relay
CPU and RSS are included on Linux, where `moq-bench-host` can read `/proc`.

`just check`, `just test`, and `just fix` all diff the branch against its base and touch only the crates that changed plus everything depending on them, which is what keeps them fast when several worktrees are building at once. They skip a language entirely when the diff doesn't touch it. Reach for `just check-all` / `just test all` / `just fix-all` when you want the unscoped suite. They also switch to it themselves once the changed-file list outgrows what a single argv/env string can hold (64 KiB, roughly 1500 paths), because the list is passed to each per-language recipe as one argument. See [Workflow](#workflow) for how the base is resolved.

To force a base, `just check origin/dev` and `just fix origin/dev` take it positionally. `just test` can't: it's a module, so `just test origin/dev` looks for a *recipe* named `origin/dev`. Name the recipe to get past that: `just test default origin/dev`.

**CI runs exactly these recipes: `just check` and `just test`, with `MOQ_STRICT=1`.** There is no separate `just ci`, so there is no second definition of "checked" to drift from this one. The split is by cost, not by environment: `check` lints and compiles (plus `tsc -b` and the Python docs, which catch what `--noEmit` and autodoc can't), while `test` links and runs the test binaries, which is the expensive half. They run as concurrent jobs in `check.yml`, because clippy emits rmeta without codegen while nextest codegens and links, so there is nearly nothing for one to reuse from the other.

The Rust build cache is written by `main` and read by pull requests, never the other way around (`.github/workflows/cache.yml`). Actions scopes cache reads to the current branch plus the default branch, so a PR-only workflow can never leave anything a *later* PR can restore, while each entry is gigabytes against a 10 GB repository budget. That is why `main` is the single writer, and why the PR jobs must stay restore-only even though the cache action already refuses to publish from a pull request. Don't add a second target-directory cache on top: it spends the same budget twice and hides whether the first one restored anything.

The main Rust check, test, OBS, and WASM jobs go through `.github/actions/rust-cache`, which owns their Swatinem action pin and cache policy. CI uses plain Cargo and restores the `target/` cache warmed by `main`; pull requests never write cache entries. Compiling recipes also accept `RUST_CARGO`, so local development can swap a `target/` per worktree for a compatible shared-store wrapper such as mr boxington. `rs/justfile` documents the three recipes that deliberately ignore it.

`MOQ_STRICT` is the one thing CI does differently. Every tool the checks use is guarded with `command -v` so an incomplete local toolchain checks less instead of failing; in CI that would be a green run that silently checked nothing, so the variable turns the required set into an up-front precondition (`_tools` in the root justfile). Required is per scope, mirroring what the diff actually dispatches, so a docs-only PR doesn't have to have gradle.

One tool stays unrequired: `swift` exists only on macOS, so swift.yml is its gate rather than the PR path.

Two path-filtered workflows run recipes of their own alongside `check.yml`, each for something the Linux `just check` can't reach: swift.yml (`swift/scripts/check.sh`, on a Mac) and obs.yml (`just obs ci`, which links the OBS plugin against nixpkgs' libobs/Qt6 -- Linux is the only platform where that needs no obs-deps download).

Five gates live outside the PR path, in `.github/workflows/nightly.yml`: `just rs audit` (cargo-deny) because an advisory lands without this repo changing, `just rs features` (the `--all-features` and `--no-default-features` compiles) because each is a full extra workspace compile that shares almost nothing with the default one, `just obs ci` because obs.yml's path filter can't be complete (a build script can change what linking `libmoq.a` needs without touching a manifest), and `just rs windows` / `just rs macos` on their own runners because the Linux jobs never compile the `#[cfg(target_os = ...)]` code at all. A break there lands on `main` rather than being caught in review, which is the accepted trade; anything that must block a merge belongs in `check`.

## Architecture

The project contains multiple layers of protocols:

1. **quic** - Does all the networking.
2. **web-transport** - A small layer on top of QUIC/HTTP3 for browser support. Provided by the browser or the `web-transport` crates.
3. **moq-net** - The networking layer on top of `web-transport`, implemented by CDNs. At session setup it negotiates one of two wire protocols: the simplified `moq-lite` protocol or the full IETF `moq-transport` protocol. Content splits into:
   - broadcast: a collection of tracks produced by a publisher
   - track: a live stream of groups within a broadcast.
   - group: a live stream of frames within a track, each delivered independently over a QUIC stream.
   - frame: a sized payload of bytes.
4. **hang** - Media-specific encoding/decoding on top of `moq-net`. Contains:
   - catalog: a JSON track containing a description of other tracks and their properties (for WebCodecs).
   - container: each frame consists of a timestamp and codec bitstream
   - watch/publish: dedicated packages for subscribing/publishing with optional UI overlays
5. **application** - Users building on top of `moq-net` or `hang`

Key architectural rule: The CDN/relay does not know anything about media. Anything in the `moq-net` layer should be generic, using rules on the wire on how to deliver content.

## Project Structure

Top-level layout only. Per-crate and per-package detail lives in the nested guides (see [Per-Directory Guides](#per-directory-guides)), which sit next to the code and don't rot here.

- `/rs/` - Rust crates: core networking (`moq-net`), native helpers, the relay, CLIs, media muxing/codecs, and the FFI/C bindings. See `rs/CLAUDE.md`.
- `/js/` - TypeScript/JavaScript packages for the browser, published as `@moq/*`. See `js/CLAUDE.md`.
- `/py/`, `/swift/`, `/kt/`, `/go/`, `/dart/` - language wrappers over `rs/moq-ffi` (see [Language Bindings](#language-bindings)). `/py/` has `py/CLAUDE.md`; the others defer to their `README.md`.
- `/cpp/` - C/C++ consumers of `libmoq`. `cpp/obs/` is the OBS Studio plugin (CMake; links `libmoq` via `MOQ_LOCAL`), licensed GPL-2.0-or-later because it links `libobs`. `just check` type-checks it via `just obs compile`, which needs headers rather than an obs-deps download, and obs.yml links it on Linux for `cpp/obs/` and `rs/libmoq/` PRs. Still manual: `just obs build` (a loadable plugin, and the only path on macOS/Windows) and `just obs test` (`cpp/obs/test/` against stubbed libobs/libmoq under ThreadSanitizer). See `doc/bin/obs.md`.
- `/demo/` - demos and test media: relay configs, the web demo, MoQ Boy, media hosting, and a network throttle script.
- `/test/` - test harnesses that span more than one language or need a server. `test/smoke/` is the cross-language interop matrix (`just test smoke[-full]`); `test/wasm/` runs the `@moq/wasm` bindings in headless Chromium against a real relay (`just test wasm`), which is the only behavioral coverage `rs/moq-wasm` has.
- `/doc/` - documentation site (VitePress, deployed via Cloudflare). The `/draft/` section is generated from `drafts/` by `doc/.vitepress/drafts.ts`.
- `/drafts/` - IETF Internet-Drafts (kramdown-rfc) for the MoQ protocols implemented here. Built and published to the datatracker via `just drafts`. See `drafts/CLAUDE.md`.

## Language Bindings

`rs/moq-ffi` is the single UniFFI core that every non-Rust binding is generated from. The wrappers under `/py`, `/swift`, `/kt`, `/go`, and `/dart` are thin layers over it, and `rs/libmoq` exposes the same core as a C staticlib. So one `moq-ffi` change ripples out to all of them (and their docs) per the [Cross-Package Sync](#cross-package-sync) table. CI mirrors the Swift and Go source packages to their external repos; Kotlin publishes `dev.moq:*` artifacts to Maven Central, and Dart publishes `moq` and `moq_ffi` to pub.dev. For Python, Dart, and other wrapped bindings, most callers want the ergonomic package rather than the generated bindings directly.

## Per-Directory Guides

Language-specific conventions, crate/package maps, and patterns live in nested `CLAUDE.md` files that load automatically when you work under that directory. Before writing code in one of these areas, read its guide (your editor loads it for you, but check it explicitly if you are reasoning about the area without opening a file in it):

- **`rs/CLAUDE.md`** - Rust workspace: crate map, Producer/Consumer model, `poll_*` plumbing, error handling, config/TOML merge, Version matching, testing.
- **`js/CLAUDE.md`** - TypeScript/JS workspace: package map, the signals + Effect reactivity model and its lifecycle rules, Web Components UI, `bun`/Biome tooling.
- **`py/CLAUDE.md`** - Python wrappers: the `moq-ffi` (generated bindings) vs `moq-rs` (ergonomic) split and the `moq` public surface.
- **`quest/AGENTS.md`** - long-term project memory: quests.

The `swift/`, `kt/`, `go/`, and `dart/` directories are thin wrappers over `rs/moq-ffi`; see each directory's `README.md` rather than a dedicated guide.

This root file holds only cross-cutting rules that apply everywhere (writing style, root-cause and maintainability rules, cross-package sync, public-API scrutiny, comment/doc conventions). When editing any of these guides, reference code by file path and symbol name, never by line number; line numbers rot with every edit. The mechanics of landing a change (branch targeting, commit messages, PR descriptions, reviews, releases) live in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

History belongs in commits and PRs; pending work belongs in a quest. Read
[`quest/AGENTS.md`](quest/AGENTS.md) whenever work mentions a quest or
questline, and use the `$plan-quest` or `$start-quest` skills when available.
GitHub issues remain the public front door for outside reports, but for
follow-up work discovered here, prefer creating a quest over filing an issue:
quests carry durable plans and dependency edges alongside the code, and land
reviewed.

## Dependencies

- When adding new dependencies, always use the **newest stable version** available.
- **Prefer a maintained third-party crate over hand-rolling non-core functionality** (standard container/codec parsers, compression, serialization, etc.). Reserve bespoke code for the wire/protocol layers where we need full control or no suitable crate exists.
- **On the CI, release, and test-harness path, cargo, bun, Python, and Dart tooling resolve from committed lock data.** Cargo and bun invocations pass `--locked` / `--frozen-lockfile`. Python project and docs dependencies resolve from `uv.lock`, while isolated build backends use exact `tool.uv.build-constraint-dependencies` pins. Dart and Flutter checks use each package's committed `pubspec.lock` with `--enforce-lockfile`. A manifest that has drifted from its lock data is a hard error instead of a silent re-resolution against whatever is newest on the registry. That drift is the window a compromised release would come through, so the failure is the point. This is enforced in the lower-level scripts too (`rs/moq-ffi/build.sh`, `rs/libmoq/build.sh`, `rs/scripts/package-windows.sh`, `test/smoke/smoke.sh`, `test/wasm/run.sh`, `test/ts/run.sh`, and the `{go,kt,swift,dart}/scripts/` bindings generators), not just their callers, so it can't be bypassed by invoking one directly. The `demo/` recipes are deliberately exempt: they are local dev conveniences that never publish an artifact.
- **A `cargo install` in CI needs a pinned version, not just `--locked`.** `--locked` fixes the tool's *own* dependencies; it does not constrain which version of the tool cargo selects, so an unpinned `cargo install foo` still picks up whatever was published most recently. Pin the version (`cargo install --locked "foo@1.2.3"`) or a git tag.
- Because of that, editing a `Cargo.toml` / `pyproject.toml` / `package.json` / `pubspec.yaml` dependency and running `just check` will fail until you regenerate the lockfile. Commit the lockfile change alongside the manifest change: `cargo update -p <crate> --precise <version>` (or a bare `cargo check`), `uv lock`, `bun install`, `dart pub get`.
- Dependabot holds newly published versions for 7 days before proposing them (`cooldown` in [.github/dependabot.yml](.github/dependabot.yml)), which buys time for a compromised release to be yanked. That gate only covers Dependabot; a hand-run `cargo update` / `bun update` / `uv lock` bypasses it, so prefer letting Dependabot drive routine bumps.

## Package Versions

**Do not bump package versions unless the user explicitly asks for a version bump or release.** Feature and fix work must leave version fields and matching lockfile version metadata unchanged. Periodic release work owns those bumps.

## Writing Style

- **No em dashes (—)** in code, comments, doc comments, commit messages, or any prose. Use a period and start a new sentence, or use a comma/parenthesis if the clauses are tightly bound.

## Comment Conventions

- Keep things brief and avoid comments if the code is self-explanatory. Reserve comments for the non-obvious WHY: a hidden constraint, a subtle invariant, a workaround for a specific bug, behavior that would surprise a reader. This is about *implementation* comments inside function bodies and on private items.
- **Public API symbols are the exception: document every exported symbol.** Each `pub` Rust item and each exported JS/TS symbol (function, class, interface, type, const, enum, plus their notable public members) gets a doc comment (`///` / `/** */`), even when it looks self-explanatory. These render on the published docs (JSR builds API docs from the `.d.ts`; docs.rs from `///`), so a missing doc is a hole a consumer hits, not a self-evident line of code. Add a module-level doc to every entrypoint too (a `/** ... @module */` block at the top of each JS entrypoint file; a `//!` block on each Rust module root). Keep these one line where possible and say what a *consumer* needs (units, ownership, lifecycle, what it wraps), not throat-clearing.
- Write the way you'd say it out loud, not the way a doc generator would. One short line is almost always enough. Skip throat-clearing like "This function is responsible for...".
- Comments must reflect the **current** state of the code, not its history. Don't write "X no longer does Y" or "this used to cascade". Describe what the code does today, or delete the comment. Migration context belongs in commit messages and PR descriptions, where it ages with the change rather than rotting in the source.
- Never tag code comments, doc comments, or `/doc` pages with AI attribution: source markers rot. The opposite rule holds on GitHub, where every LLM-authored PR body, issue, review, or comment ends with a `(Written by <model>)` marker. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Deprecation

Don't document deprecated flags, options, or APIs. User-facing docs (`/doc`), `--help`, and doc comments should describe only the current/canonical surface, so a reader is steered to the right thing and never learns the dead one. Keep the deprecated path *working* but invisible:

- Hide the deprecated symbol from every published surface: no `--help` entry, no "deprecated, use X" note in its doc comment, and drop it from the generated API docs. The per-language mechanics (clap hidden aliases, `#[doc(hidden)]` + `#[deprecated]`, `@internal`) live in [`rs/CLAUDE.md`](rs/CLAUDE.md) and [`js/CLAUDE.md`](js/CLAUDE.md).
- Remove the example invocations and prose that mention it from `/doc`.

The rename/removal rationale lives in the commit message and PR description, not in docs that users read. Warning someone who *uses* the deprecated path is not just fine but encouraged -- at compile time (Rust's `#[deprecated(note = "...")]`) or at runtime (a log line). Those fire on use, so they reach the one person who needs them and nobody else; they aren't documentation. A standing note in the docs that advertises the dead name is what's banned.

## Retries

Retry only operations that are safe to repeat and whose failure may clear without caller action. Use capped exponential backoff with jitter and normally stop after a short time or attempt budget, returning the last real error. Retry indefinitely only in process-lifetime supervisors waiting for external state; cap the delay and report failures.

Use explicit protocol semantics to fail early when available, such as authentication rejection or a non-retryable HTTP status. Avoid broad `is_retryable()` classifications for opaque failures. Exactly one layer owns each retry sequence: callers must observe its terminal result rather than recreate it and reset its budget.

## Root Cause First

- Before fixing a bug, reproduce it and explain the mechanism. A fix that adds a retry, sleep, widened timeout, defensive check, or call-site special case without a stated mechanism is a symptom patch, not a fix.
- If the mechanism lives in a lower layer, fix it there rather than working around it in the caller. The workaround becomes load-bearing and hides the bug from the next caller.
- "It's a flake" is a claim that needs evidence; assume an intermittent CI failure is a real race until proven otherwise.
- State the root cause in the PR description so reviewers can check the diagnosis, not just the patch.
- Land each bug fix with a regression test that fails without it, encoding the root cause rather than just the reported symptom.

## Refactor As You Go

A change isn't done when it works; it's done when it's the shape you'd want to maintain. Spend the extra cycles:

- A function with 4+ args, or a call site passing the same 3+ values into multiple functions, is a struct waiting to happen. Same for repeated tuples returned across modules. Make the change in the same PR rather than leaving a TODO.
- Prefer extending an existing primitive over adding a parallel one-off, and generalizing a helper over copying it. If a fix needs the same edit in N places, reshape so it's one place first, then fix.
- When a task can be solved by patching around an awkward internal shape or by fixing the shape, fix the shape in the same PR. The Public API Scrutiny "don't preserve an awkward shape just to avoid churn" rule applies to internal code too.

## Public API Scrutiny

**API design is the single most important thing to get right, ahead of fixing functionality.** We expose a huge surface area across many languages and bindings, and every public shape is something consumers build on and we have to live with. A bug can be fixed in a point release; a bad API shape costs a breaking change, a migration, and ripples through every wrapper and doc. So when functionality and API cleanliness pull in different directions, bias toward the clean API: get the shape right first, then make it work. A slightly less capable but well-shaped surface beats a feature-complete one that's easy to misuse.

Before exposing a new public type, function, or field, stop and ask: how will consumers actually call this, and what are we likely to add later? Default to the smallest surface that does the job. A simpler long-term API is worth a refactor now: reshaping today is cheaper than living with a confusing surface forever, so don't preserve an awkward shape just to avoid churn. Prefer one insulated high-level entry point (plain config in, plain result out) over exposing every building block.

Favor composable building blocks over one-off functions. A handful of orthogonal primitives that snap together beats a pile of bespoke `do_the_specific_thing()` helpers that each cover one caller and invite misuse when a caller's needs drift slightly. Each building block should do one thing and be hard to hold wrong.

**Avoid callback parameters.** Don't shape an API around a user-supplied hook (`on_close`, `with_cleanup(f)`). A callback hides when it runs and under which lock, drags `Send + Sync + 'static` bounds through the signature, and smuggles caller policy into a primitive that should stay dumb. Keep the caller in control instead: return the event and let the caller loop over it, encode cleanup in the `Drop` of a value the caller owns, or keep the policy in the caller's own type.

**Let the type system do the heavy lifting; make misuse unrepresentable rather than merely documented.** A compile error beats a runtime check beats a doc-comment warning. Encode the rules in types so the wrong call simply doesn't compile:

- **Make terminal operations consume `self`** (e.g. `fn close(self)`) so use-after-close can't be expressed, rather than taking `&mut self` and tracking a `closed` flag.
- Prefer enums/newtypes over stringly-typed or primitive args so invalid combinations don't typecheck.
- Use the typestate / builder pattern when an object is only valid in certain states, so a half-built or out-of-order call is a compile error.
- Return owned handles whose `Drop` does the cleanup instead of asking callers to remember a teardown call.

Then future-proof what you do expose so additions don't force a breaking change:

- **Config structs consumers construct with `pub` fields**: add `#[non_exhaustive]` and a `Default` or constructor. New optional fields then stay additive (callers build via `default()`/`new()` + field set, not struct literals). Prefer adding a field to an existing `#[non_exhaustive]` config over adding a function parameter. This applies only when the struct exposes `pub` fields, since `#[non_exhaustive]` is what blocks the struct-literal path. A struct with all-private fields built through a builder (`default()` + chained `.with_x()` methods) already prevents struct literals, so `#[non_exhaustive]` is redundant there; don't add it.
- **Take an options struct/object, not positional parameters, whenever a function or constructor could plausibly gain more knobs later.** A single `Config`/options bag (Rust struct, TS interface) lets you add fields without changing the signature; positional params force a breaking change (or an awkward `(track, undefined, opts)` call) the moment a second option shows up. Reach for it even when there's only one option today: a lone `compression: bool` arg is a future breaking change waiting to happen, whereas `Config { compression }` absorbs the next field for free. This applies to Rust and TS/JS, not just where `#[non_exhaustive]` does. It does **not** apply to Swift or Python: their labeled/keyword parameters with defaults already extend additively (adding a defaulted `label:`/keyword arg is source-compatible), so prefer labeled params (Swift) / keyword-only args (Python, `*, ...`) over an options bag there, matching each language's idiom.
- **Public enums that may gain variants**: add `#[non_exhaustive]` so external `match`es keep compiling.
- **Name by role, not by today's only implementation** (`capture::Config`, `publish_capture`, not `CameraConfig`/`publish_camera`) so a second implementation slots in without a rename. Don't bundle generic options under a specific-case name.
- **Namespace with modules; keep type names short.** Split a growing crate into role modules (`capture`, `encode`, `decode`) and let each own short, unprefixed names. The module already supplies the prefix, so `encode::Config` beats `EncoderConfig` and `encode::Producer` beats `VideoProducer`. But don't nest a module whose name echoes its main type: `encode::encoder::Encoder` stutters; re-export the type flat so it reads `encode::Encoder`. Re-export the public types at the role-module level (`pub use encoder::{Encoder, Config}`) and keep the file-level module (`mod encoder`) private.
- **Don't leak a third-party type** (`ffmpeg_next`, etc.) in a signature unless the crate is explicitly a thin wrapper. If you must, re-export the dependency and document that a major bump is a breaking change; keep the recommended high-level path free of it.

This applies whenever you add or widen a `pub` item, especially in library crates (`rs/moq-*`, `js/*`) with the [Branch Targeting](#branch-targeting) breaking-change rules.

## Tooling

Language-specific tooling (TypeScript/`bun`/Biome, JS async patterns, Web Components UI, Rust/`cargo`) lives in the per-directory guides. See [Per-Directory Guides](#per-directory-guides).

- **Common**: Use `just` for common development tasks
- **Builds**: Nix flake for reproducible builds (optional)
- **Local-first**: When work can live in a `just` recipe (invoked via `nix develop --command`) or as logic in a GitHub Actions workflow step, prefer the recipe. The same code then runs reproducibly on a developer machine and in CI, and is debuggable locally without pushing commits. Workflow YAML should mostly delegate to `just`; reach for plugins (`dorny/paths-filter`, custom actions, etc.) only when a recipe genuinely can't express the logic.
- **CI**: Prefer building release artifacts inside Nix (`nix build .#pkg`) over relying on runner-provided toolchains and `apt`/`brew` packages. Pinning the build environment in `flake.lock` makes artifacts deterministic and decouples them from drift in GitHub Actions runner images. Reach for the runner-native toolchain only when Nix doesn't fit (e.g. Windows runners).

## Cross-Package Sync

Changes in one area usually need matching updates elsewhere, including docs. If you skip a row, say why in the PR description.

| Change in | Also update |
|---|---|
| `rs/moq-ffi` | `rs/libmoq`, `{py,swift,kt,dart}/`, `go/wrapper/moq/*.go` (the `go/ffi` and `dart/moq_ffi` bindings regenerate automatically, but a new method needs a hand-written wrapper too, like `py/moq-rs` or `dart/moq`), `doc/lib/{py,swift,kt,go,dart,c}` |
| `rs/moq-net` wire/API | `js/net`, `doc/concept`, `drafts/draft-lcurley-moq-lite.md` (if the wire spec changes) |
| `rs/hang` catalog/container | `js/hang`, `doc/concept`, `drafts/draft-lcurley-moq-hang.md` (if the format spec changes) |
| `rs/moq-token` | `js/token` |
| `rs/moq-stats` wire (track names, frame shapes) | `doc/bin/relay/config.md` (stats section) |
| `rs/moq-relay` config/behavior | `doc/bin/relay/` |
| `rs/moq-cli` | `doc/bin/cli.md` |
| `rs/moq-token-cli` | `doc/bin/relay/auth.md`, `doc/lib/rs/moq-token.md`, `doc/lib/rs/index.md` |
| `rs/moq-gst` | `doc/bin/gstreamer.md` |
| `rs/libmoq` C ABI (`moq.h`) | `cpp/obs/src`, `doc/bin/obs.md` |
| `js/{watch,publish}` UI/API | `demo/web` if it consumes the API |
| a kramdown-rfc construct new to `drafts/` | `doc/.vitepress/drafts.ts`, which translates the drafts into `/draft/` site pages |

**Any change to the on-the-wire format MUST update the matching IETF draft under `drafts/` in the same PR.** The drafts are the normative spec other implementations (and future us) build against, so a wire change that lands without the draft update silently forks the code from the spec. This covers new/changed/removed SETUP parameters, messages, fields, framing, enum values, and version bumps anywhere under `rs/moq-net` (and the catalog/container framing in `rs/hang`). Update the draft for the specific feature you touched: `draft-lcurley-moq-lite.md` for moq-lite session/SETUP/framing, and the per-feature draft for the rest (`draft-lcurley-moq-probe.md`, `draft-lcurley-moq-cluster.md`, `draft-lcurley-moq-timestamp.md`, `draft-lcurley-moq-hang.md`, etc.). New capabilities go in as backward-compatible extensions even after a draft is published: SETUP requires receivers to ignore unknown parameter IDs, so a new parameter is additive. Validate with `just drafts check` (kramdown-rfc). See [`drafts/CLAUDE.md`](drafts/CLAUDE.md).

For wire, `moq-ffi`, or gateway changes, also run the cross-language interop matrix: `just test smoke-full` (see `test/justfile`; plain `smoke` is rust-only).

**When a command-line tool's interface changes (a flag, argument, subcommand, or positional renamed/added/removed/reordered), update every doc that shows an example invocation, not just the tool's primary page.** Sample commands for `moq-cli`, `moq-relay`, and `moq-token` are scattered across `doc/bin/`, `doc/lib/`, `doc/setup/`, and `doc/concept/`, plus the `justfile`s under `demo/`. Grep the whole repo for the binary name and reconcile each hit against the binary's `--help`. A stale example that no longer parses is worse than no example.

## Branch Targeting

PRs target `main` by default, however large the change: bug fixes, new behavior, additive APIs, docs, refactors, and wire-protocol work. `dev` is reserved for one thing, a semver break in a published API: a renamed, removed, or signature-changed `pub`/exported item, or anything else that stops existing caller code compiling, in any package someone can depend on a released version of. Adding an item is additive, so it goes to `main`. `0.0.x` packages are exempt, since every `0.0.x` release is already its own incompatible version, so break those on `main` too. Check the version, not the crate name. Full rules in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#branch-targeting).

## Workflow

When making changes to the codebase:

1. Pick the base branch per [Branch Targeting](#branch-targeting) above: `dev` only for a semver break in a published API, `main` for everything else. **When creating a new worktree, base it on the freshly-fetched remote branch** (`git fetch origin` first, then branch off `origin/main` / `origin/dev`), not on whatever local `main`/`dev` the repo happens to be sitting on. A local branch can lag the remote by many commits (or carry a stale local merge), which produces a massive conflicting PR diff against the real base at merge time.
2. **Point the branch's upstream at that base**, which is where `just check` reads it from:

   ```bash
   git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/dev   # or origin/main
   ```

   Then push with `git push origin HEAD`, **not** `git push -u`: `-u` repoints the upstream at the branch's own remote copy, and `just check` then has nothing to diff against and silently falls back to `origin/main`. On a `dev`-based branch that fallback drags in every commit `dev` is ahead by, so the check is correct but much slower than it needs to be.
3. Make your code changes
4. Run `just fix` before committing to auto-format and fix linting issues
5. Run `just check` and `just test` to verify everything passes, which is exactly what CI runs. All three only touch the crates the branch changed plus their dependents, so use `just fix-all` / `just check-all` / `just test all` when you have changed something the diff can't attribute to a package (build config, a lint rule, a shared toolchain pin)
6. Walk the Cross-Package Sync table; update paired packages and docs in the same PR
7. Add tests where they're easy to write; bug fixes need a regression test (see Root Cause First)
8. Commit and push; follow [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for commit messages, PR descriptions, and reviews
