	// stopped, since obs_output_signal_stop never checks whether the output is
	// still active. Start() also holds it from the connect through
	// obs_output_begin_data_capture, so a session that dies mid-startup cannot
	// report against an output that isn't committed yet.
	//
	// Recursive because obs_output_signal_stop and obs_output_begin_data_capture

	// libmoq locks held.
	//
	// Two costs this buys, both bounded and deliberate:
	// - A frontend that re-enters this output from a *different* thread while we
	//   hold it would deadlock, which recursion does not help with. OBS reaches
	//   one such point, the pthread_join in end_data_capture_internal. Studio's
	//   frontend queues its handlers, so it does not arise there.
	// - libmoq's runtime is single threaded, so a terminal callback parked here
	//   stalls every MoQ session in the process. The holds are short, and the
	//   expensive part of starting (obs_output_initialize_encoders) is
	//   deliberately outside the lock.
