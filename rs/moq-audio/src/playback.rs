//! The playback counterpart to `capture`, and where a
// `capture` is deliberately not a doc link: the module is behind its own
// feature, so a link to it fails the `-D warnings` rustdoc build of a
// playback-only build (what `moq-cli`'s `play` enables).
//! [`decode::Consumer`](crate::decode::Consumer) ends up:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # async fn example(mut audio: moq_audio::decode::Consumer) -> Result<(), moq_audio::Error> {
//! use moq_audio::playback;
//!
//! let engine = playback::Engine::open(playback::Config::default()).await?;
//! let mut sink = engine.sink(playback::Input {
//!     sample_rate: audio.sample_rate(),
//!     channels: audio.channels(),
//!     ..Default::default()
//! })?;
//!
//! while let Some(frame) = audio.read().await? {
//!     sink.write(&frame.data)?;
//! }
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! [`Engine`] owns the output device and [`Sink`] is one stream playing through
//! it. That split is deliberate: a call with several participants mixes into one
//! device stream rather than opening one per speaker, which is what the device
//! wants and what echo cancellation will need a single mixed reference from.
//!
//! The device is not the caller's problem. Opening it, renegotiating its format,
//! resampling to its rate, and reopening it after it disappears all happen on a
//! driver thread behind [`Engine`]; a [`Sink`] keeps taking writes throughout,
//! and its samples land wherever the device currently is.
