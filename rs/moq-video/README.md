# moq-video

Native video capture, encoding, decoding, and publishing for
[Media over QUIC](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq).

The video counterpart to [`moq-audio`](https://crates.io/crates/moq-audio).
Everything is native per-platform code with no ffmpeg dependency: capture, color
conversion, and the codec backends are all in-tree or thin wrappers over system
frameworks / vendored static libs. The public API is codec-agnostic, so no
signature, type, or error variant names a backend or a capture implementation;
swapping or bumping a backend crate is not a breaking change.

## Capture

The default-on `capture` feature exposes the device APIs and their per-platform
backends. Disable it for a codec-only build that accepts frames supplied by the
caller without pulling Linux V4L2 and libclang build dependencies.

Per-platform, picked at compile time:

- **macOS**: AVFoundation (camera) and ScreenCaptureKit (display, window, or
  application), yielding zero-copy `CVPixelBuffer` surfaces straight to
  VideoToolbox.
- **Linux**: native V4L2 (camera; YUYV resampled, MJPEG via `zune-jpeg`) and
  xdg-desktop-portal + PipeWire on Wayland (display; behind the `pipewire`
  feature), with native X11 monitor/window selection and capture as the X11
  fallback. The Wayland picker dialog chooses the screen, and the portal's
  restore token is reused so demand-driven reopens don't re-prompt.
- **Windows**: native Media Foundation (camera; `IMFSourceReader`) and DXGI
  Desktop Duplication (display), plus GDI single-window capture. Both convert
  BGRA to CPU I420 and use the ids returned by the enumerators.

`capture::cameras()` lists AVFoundation, V4L2, or Media Foundation cameras with
identifiers accepted by `capture::Source::Camera`. `capture::displays()` does
the same for macOS, Windows, and X11 displays. `capture::windows()` lists macOS,
Windows, and X11 windows. Wayland display selection stays in the desktop portal
picker, which does not expose a stable display identifier.

Embedded applications can consume raw capture without creating a MoQ
broadcast:

```rust
let mut config = moq_video::capture::Config::default();
config.source = moq_video::capture::Source::Display(None);

let mut capture = moq_video::capture::open(&config).await?;
while let Some(surface) = capture.read().await? {
    // Encode, render, or inspect the newest captured surface.
}
```

The stream retains only the newest unconsumed frame, so a slow encoder adds
drops rather than latency. `read` ends with `None` when the source stopped for
a benign reason, such as a window resize, so reopen to follow it. Permission
denial and a source disappearing are terminal, reported as
`Error::PermissionDenied` and `Error::SourceUnavailable`.

## Encode

The codec is chosen via `encode::Codec`. Backends are tried in order (hardware
first, then software) and the first that opens wins; `encode::Kind` narrows the
choice (`Auto` / `Hardware` / `Software` / a named backend).

| Codec | Software | macOS | Windows | Linux | Android |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H.264 | openh264 (vendored, static) | VideoToolbox | Media Foundation | NVENC (feature `nvidia`), VAAPI (feature `vaapi`) | MediaCodec (feature `mediacodec`, API 26+) |
| H.265 | none | VideoToolbox | Media Foundation | NVENC (feature `nvidia`) | MediaCodec (feature `mediacodec`, API 26+) |

Every backend emits Annex-B with in-band parameter sets (SPS/PPS, plus VPS for
H.265), so the matching `moq_mux::codec` importer handles framing and catalog
registration directly. There is no software H.265 encoder (it's hardware-only).

`encode::Encoder::encode` takes a raw `Frame` (a timestamp plus a `Surface`
holding the pixels) and returns `encode::Encoded`s: one whole access unit each,
carrying the timestamp of the picture it was encoded from. That matters for a
backend that buffers, which hands back an earlier frame's access unit while a
later one goes in, and for the tail `finish()` drains. Bring your own pixels with
`Surface::rgba(...)`, or feed a frame straight from capture or `decode`.

Keyframes are automatic, at the `Config::gop` interval, so an application never
has to think about them. `Encoder::keyframe()` asks for one at the next frame when
something outside the encoder needs a decodable starting point there: opening a
new group, or resuming after an idle gap. The request is held until a frame
arrives, so it is safe to call before you have one.

Two public entry points:

- `encode::publish_capture(...)` captures a webcam, encodes it, and publishes on
  demand: the track and catalog are advertised up front, but the camera opens
  only while a subscriber is watching and is released when the last one leaves.
- `encode::Producer` publishes frames you encoded yourself (`publish(&[Encoded])`),
  handling the catalog and framing. Each is published at its own timestamp.

The NVENC and VAAPI backends are Linux-only, behind the default-on `nvidia` and
`vaapi` features. Both `dlopen` the vendor driver at runtime (and fall back to
software where the driver is absent), so the binary still links on a GPU-less
builder and still starts on a GPU-less machine.

## Decode

`decode::Consumer` (the mirror of `moq_audio::decode::Consumer`) subscribes to an
H.264, H.265, or AV1 track and returns raw `Frame`s. A hardware-decoded frame stays
on the GPU: feeding it back to a compatible hardware `encode::Encoder` on the
same device keeps it there (the transcode path), while `into_i420()` downloads
it. An encoder that can't take that surface (openh264, or a different device)
downloads it through I420 for you. Every frame carries a `Surface`, a
`#[non_exhaustive]` enum naming where the pixels live (`PixelBuffer` on macOS,
`Texture` on Windows, `Cuda` on Linux, `HardwareBuffer` on Android, or CPU
`I420`). Match it to take a zero-copy path for a representation you recognize, and fall back to
`Surface::into_i420()`, which always works. On macOS `Surface::into_pixel_buffer()`
is the mirror: free for a hardware-decoded frame, an upload for a CPU one.
`Surface::into_rgba()` is the portable exit for CPU image and UI toolkits,
returning owned, tightly packed RGBA8 pixels with the surface's color metadata
applied.
Backends are tried hardware-first, like encode:

| Codec | Software | macOS | Windows | Linux | Android |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H.264 | openh264 (vendored, static) | VideoToolbox | Media Foundation (DXVA) | NVDEC (feature `nvidia`) | MediaCodec (feature `mediacodec`, API 26+) |
| H.265 | none | VideoToolbox | Media Foundation (DXVA) | NVDEC (feature `nvidia`) | MediaCodec (feature `mediacodec`, API 26+) |
| AV1 | none | none | none | NVDEC (feature `nvidia`) | MediaCodec (feature `mediacodec`, when the device provides it) |

On macOS VideoToolbox decodes H.264 and H.265 on hardware, pulling the parameter
sets (SPS/PPS, plus VPS for H.265) out of each keyframe to build the format
description. On Windows the Microsoft decoder MFT runs synchronously with a
Direct3D11 device bound to it, so the decode happens on the GPU through DXVA
(NVDEC / Intel / AMD). H.264 falls back to openh264 on a GPU-less host; H.265 has
no software decoder, so it needs the GPU path (on Windows, an HEVC decoder MFT:
the inbox HEVC Video Extensions or a vendor one). On Linux, NVDEC decodes H.264,
H.265, and 8-bit 4:2:0 AV1 to CUDA NV12 frames; AV1 is decode-only and is useful
for AV1 source to H.264/H.265 transcode rungs. A non-H.264/H.265/AV1 rendition
yields `Error::UnsupportedCodec`.
