//! Per-rung serving: just-in-time encoding of one output rendition.
//!
//! Nothing is encoded until someone asks, via the two demand paths moq-net
//! exposes on the output track:
//!
//! - A live subscription (`used`) starts a live loop that subscribes to the
//!   source track (mirroring the aggregate subscription) and transcodes group
//!   for group until the track goes `unused` again.
//! - A fetch of a specific group (`requested_group`) fetches that same group
//!   from the source and transcodes just that group with a fresh encoder.
//!
//! Output groups mirror the source group sequence numbers 1:1, so a fetch for
//! output group N maps to source group N and a player switching renditions
//! lands on the same content.
